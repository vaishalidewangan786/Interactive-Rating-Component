### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned the basic mobile-first workflow and practiced the concept of flexbox for aligning the items and making it responsive. I also learned and practiced concepts of designing like color schemes, font-selection, any other... I loved using javascript, as a beginner, I am trying to write more and more javascipt code to learn and practice it. I learned the use of Spread Syntax (...) at some point of my javascript writing as seen below
```javascript
const stars=[...document.getElementsByClassName("rate")]
```
which I found really useful. And many other similar funtionalites of html, css and javascript I got to know. Looking forward to more such knowledge-acquiring and challenges in the future.


### Continued development

I would like to make this interactive rating card component as a template which can be easily integrated with anyone's code and they can get enjoy the funtionalities of it. Also, in future I am looking forward to add transition feature after the pressing of submit button.
